Known for its strong presence in both residential neighbourhoods and city centre areas, Costcutter offers a mix of everyday groceries, fresh produce, chilled foods, baked goods, and household essentials. The stores are typically smaller in size than full-scale supermarkets, making them ideal for quick shopping trips and top-up purchases.",
