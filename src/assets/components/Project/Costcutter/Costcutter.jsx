            <p className={styles.descriptionParagraph}>Costcutter is a well-established convenience store and supermarket chain operating across Ireland, including numerous locations throughout Dublin. Known for its strong presence in both residential neighbourhoods and city centre areas, Costcutter offers a mix of everyday groceries, fresh produce, chilled foods, baked goods, and household essentials. The stores are typically smaller in size than full-scale supermarkets, making them ideal for quick shopping trips and top-up purchases.</p>

            <h2 className={styles.targetAudience}>Target audience:</h2>
            <ol className={styles.list}>
                <li>Urban dwellers seeking quick and convenient grocery options</li>
                <li>Students looking for affordable meals, snacks, and essentials</li>
                <li>Busy professionals who shop on-the-go during commutes or lunch breaks</li>
                <li>Young families needing top-up groceries and household items locally</li>
                <li>Elderly residents who prefer nearby stores with familiar, everyday products</li>
                <li>Tourists in need of quick snacks, drinks, or essentials while exploring the city</li>

            <h2 className={styles.logoProcess}>Let's go through the logo design process.</h2>
            <p className={styles.formerParagraph}>Looking at the former logo with the red swoosh underneath, I wanted to stray away from that and find an alternative communicative icon that would fit rather well with our brand.</p>
            <p className={styles.initialThought}>What came to mind first was a shopping bill and scissors cutting through it, but I thought it was too clich√© and rather illustrative for its purpose. After some thinking and brainstorming, I came down to two primitive shapes: a triangle and a circle.</p>
            <p className={styles.amazingly}>Amazingly so, there's a bit more connection to these shapes, rather than just randomly placed there.</p>
            <LogoElements customClass={styles.logoElements} logoElements={logoElements} />
            <p className={styles.logoDescription}>I wanted the roundness of the circle and the pointiness of the triangle combined into one powerful icon people can trust and rely on daily.</p>
